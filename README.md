This project is there to help other users in integrating multiple SPI devices
On the same SPI bus. Due to the prior knowledge with pcbs, 
and single SPI devices on the SPI bus, I would like to start a collaboration in setting up something that actual benefits/works 
and can be adapted easily with for other SPI devices. 

For this I use code from various other programmers as a start. I hope you will gain extended knowledge 
how to set up a instrument that can readout temperatures, or allows you to create changes to your liking and have multiple SPI devices on one. Bus running.

These are the libraries I am using. I selected them by testing them on compatibility with others libraries.
